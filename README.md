cocktail database


This is a database that is built for people in the service industry.  This can be used to customize the database to suit the particular business.  They can edit the cocktails to suit the names and brands they use.  This is also a very good tool to implement at a Bartending school.  This can be a place to store creations and share cocktails. The database can be pulled up to show via liquor or cocktail name.

This project was very interesting but took a lot of work and collabortion.  There are many moving parts that need to be organized and referenced.  

I used the labs and lectures that we did in class to refernce (ex: sodapop, quotes-a-gram, ...)

I also colloborated with many of my fellow students and team lead to help figure bugs out.  I was able to get read, update and delete to work, somewhatbuggy but working.  I need to continue to work on this and figure out the bugs and issues I am having.

Big thank you to Ashley, Dave, Eren, Shua, Kenny and Drake.  There are many others that helped and i have not mentioned but not forgotten the help.  Thank you.
